# NeuralNetworks
1 to 4 are the NN-DL solutions learned at GreatLearningCourse 
> Q1) is based on implementing the NN on MNIST datset from the scratch using the Numpy libraries, 
> Q2) is based on implementinng the TF low level code to predict the BostonHousePrices,
> Q3) is based on implementing the TFKeras to predict the BostonHousePrices (points out the difference between Q2 and Q3),
> Q4) is based on implementing the DNN on MNIST dataset using the TFKeras and analysing different hyper parameters.
